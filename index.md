## About me

Hi! I am Che Wang, a PhD student at New York University, advised by Professor [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/). My current research focuses on improving sample efficiency and achieving a better understanding of deep reinforcement learning from a fundamental level. 

I have been working as a teaching assistant for machine learning and reinforcement learning class. I often lead workshops to help students set up environments and work with hpc clusters. I also design research projects that help students learn about the entire research workflow, from coding to research paper writing.

Before becoming a PhD student, I was an undergraduate student at New York University Shanghai, as a member of the inaugural class of 2017. In addition to deep learning, I have also been interested in other topics such as game design, robotics and data visualization and have created a number of related projects during my undergraduate study.

## Teaching
* In 2019 I have taken a collegiate teaching course led by Professor Jace Hargis at NYU Shanghai.
* Since 2018 I have been working for the ML and RL class, I found that step-by-step video tutorials can be very helpful. I also tried design experimental full-scale research projects to help students learn the research workflow. 
* From 2016-2018 I have worked as a mentor and instructor at BiggerLab. A few student teams that I worked with went to participate in the 2018 MIT Battlecode contest. My experience shows that even high school students can learn AI concepts very quickly when the class is exciting enough. 
* In 2016 I was a peer tutor for the Intro to CS course and hosted a coding competition. The top prizes were drones generously sponsored by Professor Olivier Marin. 

## Service
* Serving as a reviewer for ICML, ICLR and NeurIPS. 

## Hobbies
* I found teaching to be very interesting and constantly seek to improve my skills. 
* I have been a dancer since 2013, I was one of the co-founders of the Xiaolong Shakers dance club at NYU Shanghai. 
* I am a fan of science fiction and video games.
