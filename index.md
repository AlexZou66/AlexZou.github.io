## About me

I am a PhD student at New York University, advised by Professor [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/). 
My current research focuses on improving sample efficiency and achieving a better understanding of deep reinforcement learning. 

Before becoming a PhD student, I was an undergraduate student at New York University Shanghai, as a member of the inaugural class of 2017. During my undergraduate study, I have taken a wide range of computer science courses including artificial intelligence, game programming, robotics, database, and security. I have also been working in the student government and was in charge of a number of large events.
