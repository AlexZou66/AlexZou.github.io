## About me

  I am Xinqi, a senior student at New York University, majoring in Data Science with AI concentration, and you can call me Alex. I was doing research with Professor [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/) in Deep Reinforcement Learning. My research focused on large gamma issue. I worked as a teaching assistant for machine learning course in Sophomore year. I took five graudate-level courses the time I was studying away in New York campus including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Foundation of Machine Learning. 
  Now my interest is to apply machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning skills to financial area and I will join a Chinese hedge fund as a quantative researcher after graduation.
