## About me

I am Xinqi, a senior student at New York University Shanghai, majoring in Data Science with an AI concentration, and you can call me Alex. I was doing research with Professor [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/) in Deep Reinforcement Learning. My research focused on large gamma issues. I worked as a teaching assistant for machine learning course in my Sophomore year. I took five graduate-level courses the time I was studying away on the New York campus including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Foundation of Machine Learning. 

Now my interest is to apply machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning skills to the financial area and I will join a Chinese hedge fund as a quantitative researcher after graduation.
