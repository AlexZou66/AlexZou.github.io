## About me

Hi! I am Che Wang, a PhD student at New York University, advised by Professor [Keith Ross](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/keithross/). 
My current research focuses on improving sample efficiency and achieving a better understanding of deep reinforcement learning. I have been working as a teaching assistant for machine learning and reinforcement learning class. I often lead workshops to help students set up environments, work with hpc clusters, and debugging. 

Before becoming a PhD student, I was an undergraduate student at New York University Shanghai, as a member of the inaugural class of 2017. In addition to deep learning, I have also been interested in other topics such as game design, robotics and data visualization and have created a number of related projects during my undergraduate study.
